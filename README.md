#### Rules

* Use any language you want.
* Open Book/Internet
* Don't worry about writing tests or validating input. There are no tricks
* Up to 30 minutes

#### Step 1

* There is a problem with my CSV file (data.csv).
* Fields in the file are: `model`, `location`, `year`, `VIN`, `make`
* 'Cayman' `model`s 2007 and greater need their `VIN` changed.  
  * Replace all U with an S in the `VIN`.
  * The `location` needs to change from 'Chicago' to 'St. Louis', but only if the `VIN` ends with 00001.
  * Print to the screen only changed lines.


#### Step 2

* I also have a TAB delimited file (data.tsv) with the same problem.  The data is otherwise the same. Please make your
  code optionally take CSV or TAB delimited file as input.

#### Step 3

* Optionally print the output lines in comma or tab delimited format, independent of input format.

#### Step 4

* Sort the output by VIN ascending.
